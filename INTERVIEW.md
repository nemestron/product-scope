- "Explain your TypeScript configuration and why you chose strict mode"
- "How did you handle Chrome Extension API communication?"
- "Describe your component architecture and separation of concerns"

### Chrome Extension Development
- "What permissions does ProductScope need and why?"
- "How do content scripts and popup communicate?"
- "What challenges did you face with Manifest V3?"
- "How did you handle cross-origin security restrictions?"

### Problem-Solving
- "Describe a complex technical challenge you solved"
- "How do you approach debugging in browser extensions?"
- "How did you optimize performance for real-time analysis?"

### UI/UX Design
- "Why did you choose a black-and-white color scheme?"
- "How did you implement the theme toggle functionality?"
- "What accessibility considerations did you prioritize?"
- "How do you handle responsive design in a 384px popup?"

## Key Talking Points

1. **Technical Excellence**: "I built a comprehensive analysis tool that detects 15+ technologies using multiple methods including script analysis, DOM inspection, and pattern matching."

2. **Advanced Features**: "Beyond basic tech detection, I implemented performance metrics, mobile responsiveness checks, security analysis, and social media integration detection."

3. **Professional Implementation**: "I used TypeScript strict mode throughout to ensure type safety, implemented proper error handling, and created a polished UI with theme switching."

4. **User-Centric Design**: "I focused on making the analysis results actionable with clear visual indicators and intuitive navigation between different analysis categories."

5. **Performance Optimization**: "I implemented efficient DOM traversal algorithms and optimized the content script to minimize impact on page performance."

## Demo Strategy

1. **Live Demo**: Have Chrome open with ProductScope loaded
2. **Website Variety**: Test on 3-4 different types of websites
3. **Feature Walkthrough**: Show each analysis category and explain what it reveals
4. **Theme Toggle**: Demonstrate the dark/light mode switching
5. **Complex Site Test**: Use a challenging site like Apple.com to show advanced detection
